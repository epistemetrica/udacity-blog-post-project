# Udacity Data Science Blog Post Project

Adam Wilson, July 2023

## Project Description
This project follows a CRISP-DM process to gain insights from AirBnB rental data in Seattle. The project is graded according to [this rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1507/view) and consists of the following parts:
- This [repository](https://github.com/epistemetrica/udacity-blog-post-project), including the main jupyter notebook and this README.
- A cooresponding Medium blog post communicating insights to a non-technical audience. 

## Data
Udacity suggested [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle) as a source for AirBnB rental data; however, the primary source, [Inside AirBnB](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data), offered updated data with more observations in the same format, so those data were used.

## Python Libraries
- numpy
- pandas
